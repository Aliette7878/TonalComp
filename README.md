It performs the analysis and re-synthesis of any monophonic sound, and aims to outline to the user the different steps and parameters of this process.
The analysis is based on peak tracking, while the synthesis is performed with oscillators, with a possibility to customize the final sound.

## User interface
The welcome page of user interface has two windows.  
The first one shows the different examples of monoponic sounds that can be selected.
